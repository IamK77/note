# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a knowledge repository containing study notes, documentation, and code examples across multiple technology domains. It is organized as a structured collection of markdown files and code snippets rather than a traditional software project.

## Directory Structure

- **CS/**: Computer Science fundamentals (Data Structures, OS, Networks, Computer Organization)
- **Linux/**: Linux commands, system administration, and shell usage
- **Python/**: Python programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced topics
- **Git/**: Version control and Git workflows
- **Network/**: Networking concepts and protocols
- **Resource/**: Learning resources and references
- **Workflows/**: GitHub Actions workflows for automation

## Content Type

- **Markdown files (.md)**: Study notes, documentation, and conceptual explanations
- **Python files (.py)**: Code examples and demonstrations
- **Configuration files**: Various configs and workflow definitions

## Development Notes

This repository does not contain traditional build systems or test suites. Most content is educational material rather than production code. When working with code examples:

- Python files can be run directly with `python filename.py`
- No package management (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.) exists
- Focus on maintaining educational clarity and accuracy in documentation
- Follow existing organizational patterns when adding new content

## Common Tasks

- Adding new study notes or documentation in appropriate directories
- Creating code examples to demonstrate concepts
- Organizing content into logical categories
- Maintaining consistency in file naming and structure
